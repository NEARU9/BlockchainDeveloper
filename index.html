                <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.</p>

                <h3>1.What is Blockchain</h3>
                <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.</p>

                <h3>2.Decentralization</h3>
                <p>In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.</p>

                <h3>3.Why it matters</h3>
                <p>The nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons. This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.</p>

                <h3>4.Blockchain Structure</h3>
                <p>The blockchain gets its name from its underlying structure. The blockchain is organized as a series of “blocks” that are “chained” together. Understanding blockchain security requires understanding how the blockchain is put together. This requires knowing what the blocks and chains of blockchain are and why they are designed the way that they are.</p>

                <h3>5.Basic Blockchain Operations</h3>
                <p>Operations in a decentralized networks are the responsibility of the peer participants and their respective computational nodes. These are specific for each type of blockchain.</p>

                <h3>6.Application and Uses of Blockchain Technology</h3>
                <p>Blockchain applications go far beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin. With its ability to create more transparency and fairness while also saving businesses time and money, the technology is impacting a variety of sectors in ways that range from how contracts are enforced to making government work more efficiently.</p>

                <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology is the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond digital currencies.</p>

                <h3>1.Mining and Incentive Models</h3>
                <p>Mining is the process of adding transaction details to the Blockchain, like sender address, hash value, etc. The Blockchain contains all the history of the transactions that have taken place in the past for record purposes and it is stored in such a manner that, it can’t be manipulated. An Incentive is basically a reward given to a Blockchain Miner for speeding up the transactions and making correct decisions while processing the complete transaction securely.</p>

                <h3>2.Decentralization vs trust</h3>
                <p>Blockchains, cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and oracles have emerged as new technologies for coordinating social and economic activities in a more secure, transparent, and accessible manner. Most importantly, these technologies are revealing the power of cryptographic guarantees—what we often call cryptographic truth—in restoring users’ trust in everyday interactions.</p>

                <h3>3.Blockchain Forking</h3>
                <p>A fork happens whenever a community makes a change to the blockchain’s protocol, or basic set of rules.</p>

                <h3>4.Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a blockchain, which is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.</p>

                <h3>5.Cryptowallets</h3>
                <p>A cryptocurrency wallet is an application that functions as a wallet for your cryptocurrency.</p>
